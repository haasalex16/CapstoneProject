* custom AJAX request to 'Explore' and pull 5 random tracks from the database
* Tag songs with custom tags/genres and then able to show all tracks with the same tag
* create custom playlists with all songs in database
* search returns results from Username, Song Title, Playlist Title and then you can filter by result type (search for 'bluth' to see all three types)
